Method:
	First protocol

For these submission, we first used the same protocol as presented before for the ISAAC clip submission :
1) M.D simulations were performed in two step: Host and Guest Preparation, charged and solvated with AMBER programm using antechamber and tleap. 
The host and the guest are placed in the same box, but not directly connected in order to studied the connectivity of those two substructure over time.
2) With GROMACS: Minimisation in two step with Steepest decent algorithm and 100ps of equilibration are realised with md integrator.
Each system were solvated with ~2000 TI3P water in a cubic box whose dimensions were approximately 41x 57 x 48 angstroms.
Production simulation were run in the NPT ensemble with temperature control using V-rescale thermostat at 300K and with tau_t = 0.1 and pressure control provided by Berendsen barostat. 
A cutoff-scheme=Verlet is used and the frequency to update the neighbor list is initially setted at 10 (nstlist is actually a minimum value and gmx mdrun might increase), whereas long-range electrostatics were handled with the PME method with PME order setted at 4.0.
250ns of simulation are realised for the 18 systems, with a snapshot every 0.1ps for a total of 1000 frames for all the simulations.
For all the compound, host-guest interaction are also predicted using Docking algorithm as starting point to provide initial structure. 
The docking considered all the guest as fully flexible. 
In order to sample different conformations, three different docking grid are used in order to generate poses that represent for all the guest: surface interaction, interaction inside the cavity. 
In case that we had to restained the docking inside the cavity, a minimization is performed with MOE and CHIMERA softwares in order to prevent clash between host and guest.
The formal value of free energy of interaction are calculated with xtb-GNF programm develop by S.Grimme. 
Both Enthalpy and Entropy are calculated for all the systems. After further analysis, several structure are extracted from M.D simulations, giving us a dataset of different host geometry. 
5 structures are extracted from the M.D of each hosts (OA and exo-OA) and geometric optimisation are realized at semi empirical level using GNF2B basis set. 
After verifying with hessian calculation that we have a real minima, the lowest energy structure is defined as reference for free energy calculation.
Based on the previous Docking and M.D results, several host-guest complex are optimised along GNF2B method, and as we have at least three different values for each guest, in a similar way as previously described for the host, the lowest guest is defined as reference.
A visual inspection is also realized for all the host-guest complexes.

	Second protocol

All the structure from previous SAMPL challenges interacting with OA or TEMOA structure have been extracted from SAMPL4 to SAMPL6.
For all of them, they are reconstructuted from 2D to 3D, and their geometry are optimized with along GNF2B method.
Then we used CORINA webplatform to compute 2D and 3D molecular descriptors for each of them. 200 moleculard descriptors are computed for each compounds.
Our dataset include 37 compounds in total. In order to give to the system the informations about the host, We used the same approach for the guest systems: OA, TEMOA and exoOA and generated for each of them 200 of descriptors.
For the host systems, we selected the 20 descriptors that are explaining the most the variability between thoses hosts. 
Those descriptors are implemented in the molecules extracted from previous challenge and in the dataset we now have the same molecules that differs by the descriptors of the hosts.

In our GDCC-7 dataset that have to be predicted this years we have 16 compounds (8 for OA, and 8 for exoOA), differing also by the last 20 descriptors that are descripting the host system.

The descriptors of the dataset (37 molecules extracted from previous challenge) are reduced using different approaches:
1)caret package protocol, deleting the descriptors that have a near zero variance, and deleting the most correlated descriptors.
2)Random forest calculation that game the descriptors that are the most usefull for the prediction.
3)Selection of the 60 descriptors that are explaining the most the variability of the dataset.

From all this different dataset variating from the descriptors selection, we create different data partition by using p = 0.6 to 0.8.
Finally our best results was with a 30/70 partition, including 28 obs. in the dataset and 9 in the testset.

In order to predict the free binding energy several machine learning model using regression are used: Neural network, knn, polynomial SVM and random forest are used. By modifying the parameters of all this ML models, hundreds of different models are generated.
And finally, the results presented are from neuralnetwork using "nnet" function with a RMSE of 0.918 and with MAE about 0.85 suggering that the prediction is not biaising too much by the overtraining.
