# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the letters "GDCC" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.
#
#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CD challenge, beta CD (bCD) is optional and will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.
# Likewise, for the GDCC challenge, OA binding values for guests 1-6 (but not 7-8)
# are optional as literature values are available.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:
Initial structures of host, guest molecules were protonated using Protonate3D method implemented in Molecular
Operating Environment(MOE) v2019. Complex structures were generated by docking guest molecules in to the binding
cavity of the host using general docking followed by a amber10:EHT minimization in MOE. RED Server was used to 
generate RESP charges (10.1093/nar/gkr288) for the each host and guest molecules and these charges fit to the 
GAFF using Antechamber on Amber18 to generate forcefield parameters.

The complexes were placed in a 14 Angstrom cube beyond the solute, neutralized and solvated by mimicing ionic strength of the experiment
using sodium and chloride ions with parameters from Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614),and TIP4P-Ew type water. The systems were 
relaxed under NVT conditions with 500.0,200.0, 20.0, 10.0, 5.0 and 0.0 kcal/mol restraint on the host-guest, followed by a heating to 
300K over 50 picosecond and 100ps equilibration molecular dynamics. After equilibration molecular dynamics 10ns prodution simulations 
were performed under the NPT conditions as a triplicate by using randomized starting atom velocities. The temperature of the system were 
kept at 300K by the Langevin dynamics and the pressure is coupled to 1 atm using isotropic position scaling. Non-bonded interactions were 
truncated with 10 angstrom cutoff, whereas long range electrostatic interactions were calculated with Particle Mesh Ewald. 
Hydrogen atoms were constrained using SHAKE algorithmand 2 femto-second was used as a time step. AMBER18 is used during all simulations.

The binding free energies of the guest molecules were calculated using MMPBSA.py program in Amber18 using possion boltzman solvation model
from the first 2 ns of the production runs solute entropies were corrected using normal mode frequencies calculated from snapshots of every
20ps of the initial 2ns of the production runs (10.1517/17460441.2015.1032936).
