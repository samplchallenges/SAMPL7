# METHODOLOGY

Method:
All simulations were performed with the Tinker and Tinker-OpenMM
software using the AMOEBA force field. AMOEBA parameters were generated
by the AMOEBA FORGE parameterization engine developed by Dr. Chris Ho
in collaboration with the Ponder lab. For each guest, a series of MD
simulations were run starting from the guest in water (solvation leg)
and from the host-guest complex in water (host-guest leg). In both
legs a series windows were used to first annihilate electrostatics in
the guest, followed by annihilation of guest vdw interactions. The
simulations were for a 50 Ang system, running under NPT, and with four
sodium ions added to the host-guest runs to neutralize the host. No
other ions were added, and no attempt was made to neutralize the guest.
Simulations used PME for long range electrostatics, and a 9 Ang cutoff
on vdw terms incremented by an isotropic vdw long range correction.
A two-stage RESPA-style integrator was used for the MD with a 2 fs time
step. Trajectory snapshots were save every 1 ps. For host-guest MD,
a single flat-bottomed harmonic distance restraint between groups of
atoms was used to maintain binding of the guest. These restraints were
chosen such that they were not violated during long unrestrained MD
runs on the bound host-guest complex.

Each sampling window was simulated for 10 ns and the initial 1 ns was
discarded as equilibration. The 9 ns of production simulation for each
window were then analyzed using the standard BAR method between adjacent
windows to compute free energy differences. The difference between the
sum of the solvation and host-guest legs, after correction of the host-
guest sum for release of the flat-bottomed harmonic restraint, was
taken as the binding energy estimate. Statistical error was estimated
for each BAR calculation, and these errors were summed to get a total
error for each binding free energy prediction.

We note that there are two conformations available to the host. One is
similar the annealed Amber structure released by the SAMPL organizers,
and which we call the INDENT structure. The second structure is similar
to the published crystal structure of the unligated analog of the SAMPL
host only with an extra (fourth) "cucurbituril" unit, and which we call
the OVERLAP structure. The OVERLAP structure is likely very similar to
the unreleased crystal structure that the organizers used as the initial
basis for the above mentioned Amber annealing. Both host structures are
stable in unligated form on the time scale we could simulate. We have
computed the binding free energy of all 16 guests to both forms of the
host. Since the host conformation is roughly maintained over the full
set of host-guest binding free energy windows, our estimate of the
observed binding free energy depends on the relative energy of the
two unligated host conformations. We have attempted to compute the free
energy difference between the two host conformations by various means.
The predictions contained in this file are based on direct computation
of the free energy of each host conformation in water, which suggests
the INDENT form is 2.84 kcal/mol more stable than the OVERLAP form.
Since this value is uncertain and has a large effect on our predicted
guest binding free energies, we plan to submit other prediction sets
based on alternate values for the INDENT vs. OVERLAP energy difference.
