#
# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:

# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the letters "GDCC" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.
#
#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CD challenge, beta CD (bCD) is optional and will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.
# Likewise, for the GDCC challenge, OA binding values for guests 1-6 (but not 7-8)
# are optional as literature values are available.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:
Host and guest files in several forms (mol2,pdb, and sdf) were provided from SAMPL7 organizers via Github, and we utilized mol2. 
The protonation state(s) of each molecule were assigned at experimental pH of 11.7 and AM1-BCC charges were added 
using Openeye toolkits when necessary. The updated host and guest mol2 files were converted to PDBQT and the guests were 
docked using AutoDock/Vina. We utilized a docking protocol with a grid search box of 40 cubic Angstroms from the center of the host,
a global search exhaustiveness of 80, and an energy range of 30 kcal/mol between the best and worst binding modes, all to generate
at most 100 binding modes. The grid center was placed at x_y_z coordinates -0.001, -0.435, and -0.004 respectively. Upon completion,
the pose with the highest docking score was selected for simulations. The docked guest PDBQT file was converted to PDB 
via PyMol. Subsequently, the new guest PDB was processed with the chimera program, implicent hydrogens added, protonation states
were inspected, and saved as a mol2. 

Afterwords, openeye tools was used once again to perceive bonds, determine connectivity, and compute atomic formal charges. 
The host, guest, and complex files were parameterized, solvated with TIP3P water model in a cubic box approximately 41 x 41 x 41 cubic
Angstroms via AmberTools antechamber and tleap respectively. In addition to solvation, sodium and chloride counterions were added to 
neutralize the molecules and additional ions were added to the 10mM experimental concentration. The topology and coordinate 
files (with and without solvent) of the host, guest, and complex were saved as our simulation input files.

All simulations were performed with YANK which uses OpenMM as its simulation engine with CUDA platform in the University of California, San
Diego super computing cluster (TSCC). Explicit absolute free energy calculations were performed using the PMT method at NPT, with temperature 
control using Langevin thermostat at 298K and pressure control by Monte Carlo barostat at 1 atmosphere. Long and short range nonbonded interactions
were set at an 11 Angstrom cutoff, the edge of the solvation box 12 Angstroms away from any atom of host or guest, ewald error tolerance of 0.0001, 
and Lennard-Jones interactions turned on at 10 Angstroms. Harmonic restraints were applied to all systems to keep the ligand from migrating 
away from the "binding" region of the host, yet still be able to explore the area around it. Electrostatic, steric, and restraint lambda values were
determined using YANKs automatic pipeline in a test run with bCD-g2. The lambda values were extracted and incorporated as our protocol for all systems
with a charged guest. 

An initial 500 ps simulation was used to minimize and relax all systems. The simulations contained 61 lambda windows runnning up to 26 ns per window 
to bring the free energy prediction uncertainty below 0.5 kcal/mol.
