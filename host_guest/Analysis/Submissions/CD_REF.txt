Method:

Host and guest files in several forms (mol2,pdb, and sdf) were provided by SAMPL7 organizers via Github, and we utilized mol2.  
The protonation state(s) of each molecule was assigned using Chimera (1.13.1) at experimental pH of 6.8 and AM1-BCC charges were added
using Openeye toolkits when necessary. The updated host and guest mol2 files were then processed and converted to PDBQT with 
AutoDock Tools (ADT 1.5.6). The ADT grid box feature by default identifies the grid center x_y_z coordinates of the hosts "binding
site" with a starting grid search box of 40 cubic Angstroms. The grid search box size was adjusted to fit the entire host, in 
particular the asymmetric cyclodextrin derivatives which had side chains of varying sizes. The grid box size and coordinates 
were added to relevant host-guest system script for docking with AutoDock Vina (1.1.2). In addition, our docking protocol had a global search exhaustiveness
of 100, an energy range of 20 kcal/mol between the best and worst binding modes to generate at most 100 binding modes. Upon docking 
completion, the pose with the highest docking score was selected for simulations. Upon completion, the docked guest PDBQT files were processed, 
inspected, and converted to PDB using PyMOL (1.7.4). Subsequently, the new guest PDB was processed, implicit hydrogens 
added, protonation states inspected, and saved as a mol2 with Chimera (1.13.1). 

Afterwords, openeye tools was used once again to perceive bonds, determine connectivity, and compute atomic formal charges. 
The host, guest, and complex files were parameterized from mol2 files, solvated with TIP3P water model in a cubic box by YANK (23.7). 
In addition, sodium and chloride counterions were added to neutralize the system and additional ions were added to achieve the 25mM experimental concentration. 

All simulations were performed with YANK (23.7) which uses OpenMM (1.7.1) as its simulation engine with CUDA platform in the University of California, San
Diego super computing cluster (TSCC). Explicit absolute free energy calculations were performed using the PMT method at NPT, with temperature 
control using Langevin thermostat at 300.15 K and pressure control by Monte Carlo barostat at 1 atmosphere. Long and short range nonbonded interactions
were set at an 11 Angstrom cutoff, the edge of the solvation box 12 Angstroms away from any atom of host or guest, ewald error tolerance of 0.0001, 
and Lennard-Jones interactions turned on at 10 Angstroms. Harmonic restraints were applied to all systems to keep the ligand from migrating 
away from the "binding" region of the host, yet still be able to explore the area around it. (See boresch.yaml script)  

An initial 500 ps simulation was used to minimize and relax all systems. Hosts with g1 contained 29 lambda windows simulated for 16 ns per window. (See boresch.yaml script [FILE LINK HERE]) Electrostatic,
steric, and restraint lambda values from previous free energy calculations with bCD were used. Simulations for all hosts with g2 contained 61 lambda windows 
runnning up to 26 ns per window to bring the free energy prediction uncertainty below 0.5 kcal/mol (See NOTE below). Total run lengths were adjusted on a system-by-system basis by monitoring the uncertainty associated with binding free energies as calculations progressed.
Electrostatic, steric, and restraint lambda values for systems with guest g2 were determined using YANKs automatic pipeline in a test run with bCD-g2. The lambda values were extracted and incorporated as our protocol for all systems with a charged guest. (See naharm_%_.yaml script [FILE LINK HERE])

NOTE: We observed poor overlap between states and replica mixing for systems with charged guests when conducting the simulations with 29 lambda windows. This 29 lambda window protocol was also tested on a GDCC and Clip system (which all have charged guests), and we observed poor overlap between states and replica mixing. In Clip systems even more so, YANKs mixing statistics section of the simulation health report returned a warning. 
Therefore, we decided to include a separate protocol with additional lambda windows for systems with charged guests. The number of windows and the lambda values were determined using YANKs automatic pipline in a test simulation with bCD-g2, Clip-g11, and OA-g2. The values were extracted and utilized for all systems with charged guests as noted above.
