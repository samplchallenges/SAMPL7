# Results for PHIP2 library selection
#
# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following eight elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the letters "PHIP2" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.


# PREDICTIONS SECTION
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Rank (1 through N, with N >= 100; and 1 being the top predicted compound),
# Compound ID (eg "REAL:Z1545197621"; use an ID from REAL or MOLPORT but not both),
# SMILES string, source file (e.g. "all.txt" or "output-hops1-hac3-rac1.txt"),
# confidence that binding is improved (1-10, with 10 being most confident)
#
# Note that you will likely want to justify your specific predictions/choices in your Method section, as our
# evaluators will read there to determine why you have made the choices you did.
#
# As per challenge rules, depending on participation, we may be considering only your top 10 ranked compounds, and
# selection for screening will depend on whether the compounds seem reasonable and on your justification for
# your choices. 
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which of the method category labels describe your prediction the best: `Docking`, `Ligand-based`, `MD`, `ML`, `Other`, `Null`.
# If your method takes advantage of multiple approaches please report more than one category label, separated by comma.
# `Docking` category refers to structure-based virtual screening methods that model the structure of the receptor binding pocket and pose of the ligand followed by an scoring the goodness of the fit .
# `Ligand-based` methods are virtual screening methods that do not rely on protein structure such as pharmacophore modeling, ligand shape-based, 2D or 3D structural similarity based methods.
# `MD` methods utilize molecular dynamics simulations based on molecular mechanics including free energy calculations.
# `ML` category includes machine learning, QSPR approaches, and all prediction methods trained on empirical knowledge.
# `Null` predictions employ a model which is not expected to produce useful predictions, however,  can provide a simple comparison point for more sophisticated methods, as ideally, good methods should outperform the null model.
# If these categories do not match your method, report as “Other”.
# If you choose the `Other` category, please explain your decision in the beginning of Method Description section.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.

Method:
To assure the accuracy of docking simulation in consideration of fragment follow-up, the all.txt compounds were filtered by the following conditions.
(20 <= heavy atoms <= 34) and (2 <= hydrogen bond donors) and (0.5 <= Fsp3 <= 1.0) and (3 <= rotatable bonds <= 10) and (2 <= aromatic rings <= 3) and (1 <= aromatic heterocycles) and (1 <= aliphatic rings <=2) and (((aromatic rings)+(aliphatic rings)) <= 4) and (360 < molecular weight < 440),
which resulted in 163125 compounds.
Then, to reduce the number of compounds further, those compounds which contain amide bonds were excluded except tertiary amides and lactams, which resulted in 27207 compounds in total.

The 27207 compounds were then filtered by template filtering. Among the cocrystal structures of the Stage 2, the binding poses of F367, F389, F558 and F584 were chosen and merged to construct the pharmacophore template using Molegro Virtual Docker. Using Ligand Evaluator mode, the 27207 compounds were filtered by the template and top 10% (2750 compounds) of those were selected.

Finally, the 2750 compounds were scored by template docking using above-mentioned template and the apo structure of PHIP2.
The final list of 16 compounds were selected followingly.

1, REAL:PV-000076313713, Best in ((3*LE3)+(SimilarityScore/HeavyAtoms))
2, REAL:PV-002045872457, Best in (SimilarityScore/HeavyAtoms) and DockingScore and SimilarityScore
3, REAL:PV-000062484624, Best in LE3
4, REAL:PV-002002900770, Best in RerankScore
5, REAL:PV-002045938857, Other outliers in LE3-SS/HA plot
6, REAL:PV-002030117876, Other outliers in LE3-SS/HA plot
