# SAMPL7 protein-ligand (PHIP2) stage 1  analysis

- Analyses were generated by executing `bash run.sh` in the `/Scripts` directory
- The script generates confusion matrices for all submission at each site individually and groups the results for `ranked`, `non-ranked` and `ranked_and_non-ranked` submissions 
- The predictions are bootstrapped to evaluate the possible error within each submission
- The balanced accuracies and precision scores are barplotted from the confusion matrices
