# Results (entry description) for PHIP2 pose prediction
#
# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the letters "PHIP2_2" and then be followed by an additional underscore or dash
# along with whatever characters you like, and end with ".txt"
#
# Please refer to https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL7/blob/master/protein_ligand/README.md for a full
# description of how to format your submissions.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.
#
#
# NOTE: Unlike the Stage 1 submission, this file does NOT provide your entries. Rather, it must be
# included in the .tar.gz file you upload which contains your submissions. Thus, no "predictions" section
# is required.

# PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SECTION
#
# Please list your name, using only UTF-8 characters as described above. The "Participant name:" entry is required.
Participant name:
Chunyu Yu
#
# Please list your organization/affiliation, using only UTF-8 characters as described above.
Participant organization:
Peking University, China


# METHOD NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide a brief (40 character limit) informal yet informative name of the method used.
# Following is sample text; please edit to your taste.
# The "Name:" keyword is required, as shown here.
# 40 character limit.
Name:
gnina_ML


# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# All major software packages used and their versions.
# Please use a new line for each software.
# Following is sample text; please edit to your taste.
# The "Software:" keyword is required.
Software:
gnina;scikit-learn


# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which of the method category labels describe your prediction the best: `Docking`, `Ligand-based`, `MD`, `ML`, `Other`, `Null`.
# If your method takes advantage of multiple approaches please report more than one category label, separated by comma.
# `Docking` category refers to structure-based virtual screening methods that model the structure of the receptor binding pocket and pose of the ligand followed by an scoring the goodness of the fit .
# `Ligand-based` methods are virtual screening methods that do not rely on protein structure such as pharmacophore modeling, ligand shape-based, 2D or 3D structural similarity based methods.
# `MD` methods utilize molecular dynamics simulations based on molecular mechanics including free energy calculations.
# `ML` category includes machine learning, QSPR approaches, and all prediction methods trained on empirical knowledge.
# `Null` predictions employ a model which is not expected to produce useful predictions, however,  can provide a simple comparison point for more sophisticated methods, as ideally, good methods should outperform the null model.
# If these categories do not match your method, report as “Other”.
# If you choose the `Other` category, please explain your decision in the beginning of Method Description section.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Docking
ML

# RANKING INFORMATION SECTION
#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
Ranked:
True


# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of detail should be at least that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters, with units, and explain how any
# statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions (e.g. counterions) and pKa effects
# Following is sample text; please edit to your taste.
# All text following the "Method:" keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
Method:
I used gnina to dock provided molecules to the given pdb file in stage 1, and used a machine-learning mehods to rescore the results.
