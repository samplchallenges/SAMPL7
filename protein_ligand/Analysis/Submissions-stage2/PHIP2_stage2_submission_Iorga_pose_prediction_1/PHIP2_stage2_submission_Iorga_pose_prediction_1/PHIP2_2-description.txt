# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which of the method category labels describe your prediction the best: `Docking`, `Ligand-based`, `MD`, `ML`, `Other`, `Null`.
# If your method takes advantage of multiple approaches please report more than one category label, separated by comma.
# `Docking` category refers to structure-based virtual screening methods that model the structure of the receptor binding pocket and pose of the ligand followed by an scoring the goodness of the fit .
# `Ligand-based` methods are virtual screening methods that do not rely on protein structure such as pharmacophore modeling, ligand shape-based, 2D or 3D structural similarity based methods.
# `MD` methods utilize molecular dynamics simulations based on molecular mechanics including free energy calculations.
# `ML` category includes machine learning, QSPR approaches, and all prediction methods trained on empirical knowledge.
# `Null` predictions employ a model which is not expected to produce useful predictions, however,  can provide a simple comparison point for more sophisticated methods, as ideally, good methods should outperform the null model.
# If these categories do not match your method, report as “Other”.
# If you choose the `Other` category, please explain your decision in the beginning of Method Description section.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Docking


# RANKING INFORMATION SECTION
#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
Ranked:
True


# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION

Method:
From literature data we have created a validation dataset containing 1499 compounds, with 45 active compounds among them (identified by X-ray crystallography and/or AlphaScreen assay). This represents 3% of active compounds identified overall.
We have also identified in the PDB 8 crystal structures containing fragment-like ligands.
From the analysis of conformations of the four binding sites indicated by the organizers in these structures we found 3 representative conformations for site 1, 2 conformations for site 2, 1 conformation for site 3 and 3 conformations for site 4.
3D conformations of compounds from validation and prediction datasets were generated from SMILES using CORINA  v4.2.0, then protonated to physiological pH with Schrodinger LigPrep v48012.
The 1499 compounds were docked on each conformation of the four binding sites using Gold with 4 scoring functions: GoldScore, ChemScore, ASP and ChemPLP. 50 poses were generated for each ligand in all docking calculations.
For timing reasons only the docking poses for site 1 were analyzed, by looking at the ranking of the 45 active compounds and at the pose prediction (RMSD values calculated using in house scripts and CACTVS Chemoinformatics Toolkit V3.4.6.26) for the ligands from the 8 crystal structures. In both cases, ChemScore with the second conformation of site 1 provided significantly better results (although not very satisfactory) compared to the other combinations of scoring functions and site conformations.
Then, the active compounds provided by the organizers were docked using the same protocol and docking parameters as above. The best ranked pose was submitted.
