#
# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following eight elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the letters "PHIP2" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.


# PREDICTIONS SECTION
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Fragment identifier, binding in S1 (true/false), binds in S2 (true/false), binds in S3 (true/false), binds in S4 (true/false), binds overall (true/false).
# Any compounds not listed are assumed to be predicted as nonbinders.
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Predictions:" keyword, as illustrated here.
Predictions:
F1, true, true, true, true, true
F10, false, true, false, false, true
F20, false, false, true, false, true
F30, false, false, false, true, true
F40, true, false, false, false, true
F50, false, false, false, false, false


# PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SECTION
#
# Please list your name, using only UTF-8 characters as described above. The "Participant name:" entry is required.
Participant name:
David Mobley
#
# Please list your organization/affiliation, using only UTF-8 characters as described above.
Participant organization:
University of California, Irvine


# METHOD NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide a brief (40 character limit) informal yet informative name of the method used.
# Following is sample text; please edit to your taste.
# The "Name:" keyword is required, as shown here.
# 40 character limit.
Name:
OEDocking-template


# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# All major software packages used and their versions.
# Please use a new line for each software.
# Following is sample text; please edit to your taste.
# The "Software:" keyword is required.
Software:
OpenEye docking toolkit v1.1


# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which of the method category labels describe your prediction the best: `Docking`, `Ligand-based`, `MD`, `ML`, `Other`, `Null`. 
# If your method takes advantage of multiple approaches please report more than one category label, separated by comma.  
# `Docking` category refers to structure-based virtual screening methods that model the structure of the receptor binding pocket and pose of the ligand followed by an scoring the goodness of the fit .
# `Ligand-based` methods are virtual screening methods that do not rely on protein structure such as pharmacophore modeling, ligand shape-based, 2D or 3D structural similarity based methods.
# `MD` methods utilize molecular dynamics simulations based on molecular mechanics including free energy calculations.
# `ML` category includes machine learning, QSPR approaches, and all prediction methods trained on empirical knowledge.
# `Null` predictions employ a model which is not expected to produce useful predictions, however,  can provide a simple comparison point for more sophisticated methods, as ideally, good methods should outperform the null model.
# If these categories do not match your method, report as “Other”.
# If you choose the `Other` category, please explain your decision in the beginning of Method Description section.  
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Docking, MD


# RANKING INFORMATION SECTION
#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
Ranked:
True


# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of detail should be at least that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters, with units, and explain how any
# statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions (e.g. counterions) and pKa effects
# Following is sample text; please edit to your taste.
# All text following the "Method:" keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
Method:
Compound conformers were generated with OpenEye Omega (version XYZ) with the OpenEye toolkits,
then docked to the prepared receptor with the OpenEye docking toolkits using the
python code snippet provided below, with the Chemgauss4 scoring function, with each site treated in a separate pass.
(Insert code snippet here).
Binders were predicted based on compounds scoring more favorably than a threshold score of (insert value)
in any site.
