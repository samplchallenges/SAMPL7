    "\n",
    "The Comer et al. paper, and Sirius's slide deck, provide more context to indicate that P^0 is the partition of the neutral species and P^1 the partition of hte +1 species, etc. This means the above analysis, where I was exponentiating instead, is completely a mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "My key question to proceed is how to get P^0 and P^1 etc for an example case, like SM41, but Figure 4 in the Comer paper suggests a path forward as the graphs look a lot like those in the Sirius report for this particular compound; the caption says \"Partial lipophilicity profiles derived using equations 8 or 9, after calculating logP^N from the data in graphs (a) and (b) using Eqns 10 or 11.\" This basically describes data I have from Sirius, and I have equations 10 and 11 (though one concern is these are for the monoprotic case only, but still I can try).\n",
    "\n",
    "The other concern is that Eq. 10-11 have r, a volume fraction, which does not occur in the Sirius report, but that's a minor/surmountable issue I think. I am also not sure I know $p_o K_a$, the pKa in octanol, but perhaps this can be figured out. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's try that. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Begin with $p_o K_a$. Where do I get it? Sirius slide deck (e.g. ch 7 slide 2) indicates it's the shifted pKa in the presence of octanol. (There is also a special version of this, the limiting one, called the Scherrer $p_o K_a$, which occurs in octanol saturation, but that is not what we need here.) \n",
    "    - **But where exactly does the $p_o K_a$ come from?** \n",
    "       - It's PROBABLY the rightmost shifted pKa in the \"mean molecular charge\" graph. Checking by viewing underlying data\n",
    "       - XLS spreadsheet has theoretical mean molecular charge as based on pKa in columns\n",
    "       - Next to it there's the actual one \"shifted due to solvent\" run at three solvent concentrations (not themselves stated)\n",
    "       - So probably use the rightmost of these \n",
    "       - pH that concentration hits 0.5 is about 7.3 (between 7.18 and 7.4)\n",
    "- Now what about $r$?\n",
    "    - Could use just a placeholder value of some kind\n",
    "    - There is no data in the paper on what $r$ is, nor in the Sirius report\n",
    "    - Emailed Karol/Carlo asking\n",
