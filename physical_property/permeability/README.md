## SAMPL7 PAMPA Permeability Prediction Challenge (closed)

The SAMPL7 PAMPA Permeability Challenge consists of predicting the permeabilities of 22 molecules. This challenge is *optional* and will be run at the same time as the pK<sub>a</sub> and partition coefficient challenge (both of which are also optional).

Provided is a `.CSV` file containing IDs and SMILES strings for each molecule in the form of `SMXX` from SM25 to SM46. The enumerated microstates for each molecule and the `.MOL2` and `.SDF` files for each microstate can be found [here](physical_property/pKa/microstates/).

Instructions for the permeability challenge: [`permeability_challenge_instructions.md`](permeability_challenge_instructions.md)

Submission template for the permeability challenge: [`submission_template/permeability_prediction_template.csv`](submission_template/permeability_prediction_template.csv)

Please note that permeabilities for compounds `SM33`, `SM35`, and `SM39` were *not* determined, so these compounds are optional. Additionally, compounds `SM35`, `SM36` and `SM37` are enantiopure and have a chiral center. All other compounds are not chiral. The version of these compounds with specified chirality should be used; refer to challenge instructions for more details.

Experimental permeability data will made available after the challenge deadline.
