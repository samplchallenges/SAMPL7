## What's here
- [`analysis/`](analysis/) - Analysis of log *D* predictions. Analysis is similar to that found in `../analysis_outputs_all_submissions/` except it includes some additional pK<sub>a</sub> and log *P* combinations (for log *D*  estimation). Method name *logP_experimental + EC_RISM* combines the experimental log *P* with the top performing pK<sub>a</sub> method (based on RMSE), method *logP_experimental + pKa_experimental* combines the experimental log *P* and pK<sub>a</sub> value, method *TFE MLR + EC_RISM* combines the best performing (based on RMSE) log *P* and pK<sub>a</sub> methods, method *TFE MLR + pKa_experimental* combines the best performing (based on RMSE) log *P* method with the experimental pK<sub>a</sub>, method *logP_experimental + DFT_M05-2X_SMD* combines the experimental log *P* with an average performing pK<sub>a</sub> method, method *NES-1 (GAFF2/OPC3) B  + pKa_experimental* combines a log *P* method with average performance with the experimental pK<sub>a</sub>.
  - `error_for_each_logD.pdf` - Violin plots that show error distribution of predictions related to each experimental log *P*.
  - `logDCorrelationPlots/` - This directory contains plots of predicted vs. experimental log *P* values with linear regression line (blue) for each method. Files are named according to the submitted method name of each subission, which can be found in `statistics_table.csv`. In correlation plots, the dashed black line has a slope of 1. Dark and light green shaded areas indicate +-0.5 and +-1.0 log *P* unit error regions, respectively.
  - `logDCorrelationPlotsWithSEM/` - This directory contains similar plots to the `logDCorrelationPlots/` directory with error bars added for Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) of experimental and predicted values for submissions that reported these values. Experimental log *P* SEM values are either too small to be able to see the horizontal error bars, or some of the experimental log *P* SEM values were not collected.
  - `AbsoluteErrorPlots/` - This directory contains a bar plot for each method showing the absolute error for each log *P* prediction compared to the experimental value.
  - `StatisticsTables/` - This directory contains machine-readable copies of the Statistics Table, bootstrap distributions of performance statistics, and overall performance comparison plots based on RMSE and MAE values.
      - `statistics.csv`- A table of performance statistics (RMSE, MAE, ME, R^2, linear regression slope(m), Kendall's Tau, and error slope(ES)) for all the submissions.
