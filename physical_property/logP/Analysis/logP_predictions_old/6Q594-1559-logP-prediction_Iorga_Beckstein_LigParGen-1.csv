# OCTANOL TO WATER (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) TRANSFER FREE ENERGY PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, SM25_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty, (optional) logD, (optional) SEM logD
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# You may optionally provide predicted logD values; these will be used as a consistency check on our estimated logD values if you submit both logP and pKa values.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
Alchemical free energy calculations were performed in explicit
solvent, following the protocol described in [1,2]. Parameters were generated with  the
OPLS/CM1A LigParGen server http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/ for
OPLS-AA with the TIP4P water model. Files were prepared for Gromacs
2020.3. The alchemical data were analyzed with thermodynamic
integration. Errors are reported as errors of the mean (see [1,2]). The
model uncertainty was estimated on the basis of the results from [2].
