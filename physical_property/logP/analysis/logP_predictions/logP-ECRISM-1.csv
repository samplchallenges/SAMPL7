Method:
For microstates with multiple possible stereoisomers these were generated using Corina.
50 geometries, or 200 for molecules containing more than seven rotatable bonds, were generated for each microstate using the EmbedMultipleConfs function of RDKit. These structures were pre-optimized with Amber 12 using GAFF 1.7 parameters and AM1-BCC charges with an ALPB model to represent the dielectric environment of water and n-octanol, respectively.
Conformations with an energy of more than 20 kcal/mol than the minimum structure of that microstate were discarded and the remaining structures clustered with a structural RMSD of 0.5 Angstrom. The cluster representatives were then optimized using Gaussian 16revC01 with IEF-PCM using default settings for water or n-octanol respectively at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory.
Additional stereoisomers were treated as if they were additional conformational states so that for each microsate only up to 5 conformations with the lowest PCM energies for each solvent were treated with EC-RISM/MP2/6-311+G(d,p) using the PSE2 closure for water and the PSE1 closure for n-octanol [REF1] and the resulting EC-RISM energies corrected using (c1*mu_{ex}+c2*PMV_{EC-RISM}) since only neutral species were considered for the calculation of the transfer free energy. The correction for water has a fixed parameter c1 = 1 since this additional parameter was found to be of no predicitve value in previous challenges and c2 = -0.1025 kcal*mol^-1*A^-3 while for octanol c1 = 1.2915 and c2 = -0.0141 kcal*mol^-1*A^-3 [REF2].
The transfer free energy of a compound was then calculated by dG_trans=G_{oct}-G_{wat}, where G_{m} refers to the partition function estimate of the solvent specific free energy by summing over the conformational and tautomer states [REF3]. The log P can then be calculated by log P = dG_trans/(-RT*ln(10)). The log D was calculated at a pH of 7.4.
The SEM was estimated as the convergence criterion for a single EC-RISM calculation. The uncertainty was estimated as the RMSE of the n-octanol-water transfer free energy dataset contained within the Minnesota Solvation Database.
