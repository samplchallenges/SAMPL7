#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, SM25_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty, (optional) logD, (optional) SEM logD
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# You may optionally provide predicted logD values; these will be used as a consistency check on our estimated logD values if you submit both logP and pKa values.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Computing and hardware:
All simulations were performed on the Pitzer Cluster at the Ohio Supercomputer Center
(https://www.osc.edu/resources/technical_support/supercomputers/pitzer). Calculation involving water
were peformed using 10 processors per calculation, while the calculation involving octanol
were performed using 8 processors per calculation. The reported compute time is taken as the
walltime times the number of processors (core hours). Pitzer has a mix of processors. We did not specify the
processor type upon submission, so a mix was used. All of the calculations were performed during a
trial period during the cluster expansion. The original Pitzer cluster was installed in late 2018 and
is a Dell-built, Intel Xeon Skylake processor-based supercomputer with 260 nodes.
In September 2020, OSC installed an additional 398 Intel Xeon Cascade Lake processor-based
nodes as part of a Pitzer Expansion cluster.

Method:
Solvation free energy calculations were performed using molecular dynamics with Gromacs plus MBAR at 298.15 K and 1 bar
in water (pure) and 1-octanol (pure). The solute was coupled/decoupled using a total of 15 states (including
ideal gas and fully interacting states). After equilibration, 16 ns tranectories were used for the free energy calculations.
The uncertainty in the solvation free energy calculations was computed using a timeseries analysis
as implemented in PyMBAR. The model uncertainty was taken as the rough estimate used in the
SAMPL6 overview publication.

Water and 1-octanol were modeled using TIP4P and TraPPE-UA, respectfully.
In this set of calculation 1-octanol was modeled as pure. In a second set of
calculation we will use water-saturated 1-octanol. The combination of models
was used as their phase behvaior has been rigorously studied in the past, with
LLE calculations performed to determine mutual solubilities.

The solutes were modeled using GAFF with point charges obtained using RESP
with HF/6-31G(d).
