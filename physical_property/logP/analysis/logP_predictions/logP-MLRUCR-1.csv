#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, `SM26_micro000 SM26_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty, (optional) logD, (optional) SEM logD
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# You may optionally provide predicted logD values; these will be used as a consistency check on our estimated logD values if you submit both logP and pKa values.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
A Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was made from experimental logP values from 60 sulfonamides, obtained from PubChem and DrugBank. The dataset contained mainly sulfonamide drugs and smaller molecules with other classsical functional groups. In order to crate the MLR, the following descriptors were used: the frenquency of functional groups, hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), hydrogen bond donors (HBD), molar refractivity (MR) and Topological polar surface area (PSA). The functional groups frequency was calculated with a in-house script from a modified function of OpenBabel, the rest was obtained from supplied OpenBabel properties.

# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
