# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
Method:
We built a deep neural network model to predict log P values. The input vector contains consists of a 1024 size bit vector of Morgan Fingerprints. The dense NN contains 5 hidden layers with 512,512, 256, 128 and 64 units. Input training data was obtained from Popova et.al.(Science Advances  25 Jul 2018:Vol. 4, no. 7, eaap7885 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aap7885). 5-fold cross validation was performed on the training data.) This same model was employed in the SAMPl6 competition. Following the calculation of logP, the values were converted to kcal/mol.
