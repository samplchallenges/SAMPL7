Method:

Simulation setup was done using the AMBER 18 MD simulations package. The molecules pdb files were obtained through SMILES strings available in the challenge GitHub repository and the molecular building software Avogadro.  The TIP4P-EW force field for water and GAFF force field with AM1-BCC charges for octanol and solutes with parameters generated using AmberTools 18.  Topology files were obtained through antechamber and the built-in tool LEaP.  Boxes of side 34 Angstroms were created using Packmol for both pure solvents and solutions. Octanol boxes contain 150 molecules and 1 solute molecule, while water boxes contain 1300 water molecules and 1 solute molecule.

For all simulations a 5000 steepest descent minimisation of the system followed by a 200 ps heating phase of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to 298 K was employed. Both equilibrium and production MD simulations were run in the NPT ensemble with target pressure 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat and relaxation time constant tauP = 2.0ps and a simulation time step of 2 fs using the SHAKE algorithm for bond lenght constraints involving hydrogens. Temperature was controlled using Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency gamma= 5.0 ps-1. Non-bonded interactions were calculated with a cut-off distance of 10.0 Angstroms and Particle-Mesh Ewald for long-range electrostatic interactions.  Systems were equilibrated for 25 ns and data was collected for 100 ns.

Free energies are evaluated using the energy-entropy (EE) method whereby G = H - TS. Energy is calculated directly from the simulation and entropy is calculated using Multiscale Cell Correlation (MCC). MCC uses the forces and coordinates generated in the MD simualtion.[1,2,3] Entropy S of a system is calculated as:
        S_liquid = N*S_solvent
        S_solution = N*S_solvent + S_solute
where S_solvent is the entropy of a single molecule and N is the number of molecules.
For partition coefficients, simulations are run of both pure water and octanol and of solutions of each solute in water and octanol. 
The transfer free energy of the solute into solvent i equals
        ∆G_i = G_solution − G_liquid
The final free energy difference for transfer from water to octanol is
        ∆G_transfer= ∆G_octanol - ∆G_water

Each simulation was done in triplicate to assess the statistical uncertainty of the model, yielding a Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) calculated as
	SEM=s/(sqrt(n))
where s is the standard deviation and n the number of repetitions. Model uncertainty is 1.3 kcal/mol based on the root-mean squared error of the energy due to GAFF as found in literature.[4]
