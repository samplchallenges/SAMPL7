#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, SM25_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty, (optional) logD, (optional) SEM logD
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# You may optionally provide predicted logD values; these will be used as a consistency check on our estimated logD values if you submit both logP and pKa values.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Computing and hardware:
All machine learning model training was conducted on a single machine hosting an Intel Core i7 5820K overclocked to 4.2Ghz.
Automated model searching, including hyperparameter tuning, model training, and cross-validation, for an initial population of 100 models over 10 generations was conducted in parallel on the six CPU cores.
The wall clock time taken to complete model searching was 11.7 hours, of which approximately 75% was spent doing parallel work and 25% conducting the initialisation of each generation in serial.

Method:
Datasets: Structures from the Mansouri [1] and Martel [2] LogP datasets were combined to form an initial 14,707 chemical training dataset. Curation consisted of salt and solvent removal, adding explicit hydrogens, retaining only the heaviest fragments of mixtures, and neutralisation of any charged structures in ChemAxon Standardizer. An additional 15 compound dataset consisting of structures with sulfone functional groups and experimental LogP values was selected from the DrugBank database. The Mordred library [3] generated 2D descriptors for these datasets, along with the 22 compound SAMPL7 LogP Prediction Challenge molecules.
Modelling: The TPOT library [4] automated model searching and hyperparameter tuning using a genetic algorithm configured to optimise a population of 100 models for the lowest mean absolute error in LogP prediction over 10 generations. This model was validated on the held out 15 sulfone compound dataset with 0.42 RMSE.
TFE conversion from LogP to TFE: Standard state conditions were assumed in the conversion of predicted LogP values from the TPOT model to transfer free energies. This consisted of multiplying the predicted logP by the temperature (T=298K), gas constant (R=1.986x10^-3 kcal/K.mol) and 2.303 [5].
Statistics: Statistical uncertainty was estimated by taking the standard deviation of the transfer free energies predicted by this model, and an earlier initial model trained with a population of 10 models for 10 generations used for prototyping. The standard error of the mean was calculated by dividing this standard deviation by the square root of 2.
