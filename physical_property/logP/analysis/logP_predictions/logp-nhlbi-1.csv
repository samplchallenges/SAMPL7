# WATER-OCTANOL  TRANSFER FREE ENERGY PREDICTIONS
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.


# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
# ID tag, Molecule ID, TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#predictions were updated after submission--- submitted log P values had the wrong sign, in agreement
# with the methods section the participant accidentally inverted the log P convention

# COMPUTING AND HARDWARE SECTION

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
Method:
Def2-TZVP basis sets were used for all calculations. All calculations were performed in either Gaussian 09 or Gaussian 16. All challenge molecules were converted to 3d coordinates using OpenBabel from the SMILES string. Structures were then optimized with the B3LYP density functional and were verified to be local minima via frequency calculations on an ‘ultrafine’ integration grid with harmonic frequencies. The transfer free energy was calculated by (\Delta G_water - \Delta G_octanol) and are reported in kcal/mol.
