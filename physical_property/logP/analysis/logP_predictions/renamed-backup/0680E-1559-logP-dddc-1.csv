# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, `SM26_micro000 SM26_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Data Curation and Preparation
Data were collected from literature and databases. More detail are not shown.
The compound structures were cleaned and normalized by our in-house script. 
If a compound had multiple logP, the arithmetic means of all values as the final annotation, 
unless the reported logP values covered a range of more than 0.5. 
Since the number of records is too large, random samping was performed on the full datset.
About half of the compounds were randomly selected for model buiding within the limited time.
The final dataset consists of 13374 compounds.

Model building
All compounds were randomly dividied into training and test set by a ratio of 4:1.
Five-fold cross-validation was performed within the training dataset duringthe training process. 
In detail, training dataset was split into five folds 
and each fold is then used onceas a validation, whereas the four remaining folds form the training set.
For each fold, early stopping was applied and the training process.
We set a maximum epoch of 500, and if the performance root mean squared error (RMSE) had not improved in 8 epochs on the training set and in 18 epochs on the validation set, 
the training process was terminated early. 
Attentive FP[1] that have previously reported by our group was applied to build prediction model.
The six hyper-parameters were set as following: k (the number of attentive layers for atom embedding) = 4, 
t (the number of attentive layers for molecule embedding) = 4, 
fingerprint dimension = 256, L2 weight decay = 10^-5, learning rate = 10^-5, and dropout rate = 0.4. 
Finally, the predictions of logP were converted into transfer free energy (TFE) through multiplying by -1.364.
We performed three independent runs with different random seeds to train the model and obtain the standard error of the mean (SEM) as a measure of statistical uncertainty.
Model uncertainty is calculated as the RMSE between predicted and experiment values for test set.
