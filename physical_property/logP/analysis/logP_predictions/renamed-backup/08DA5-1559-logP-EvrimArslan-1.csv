Category:
Physical (QM)

Method:
All possible conformations of the ligands are located with the semi-empirical PM3 method by using the SPARTAN software. Free rotations around single bonds are taken into account and all the geometries corresponding to stationary points are re-optimised with the Gaussian software package by density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP-D3 functional and the 6-311+G(d,,p) basis set. Solvation Model based on Density (SMD) method at 298.15K is used for the optimizations of the conformations in water (e=78.36) and octanol (e=10.30). Equation 1 is used to calculate the log(KOW) value of the molecules corresponding to the global minima
log(KOW)=[DG_solv(water)-DG_solv(octanol)]/2.303RT   (Equation 1) 
#For the calculation of standard error of mean (SEM) standard deviations (stdev) are calculated according to the Equation 2 where value is the TFE (transfer free energy) of the each molecule, mean is the mean of TFEs of the molecules of interest and N is the size of the population
stdev = sqrt((1/(N-1))*(sum of (value-mean)^2))  (Equation 2)
After calculation of standard deviations standard error of mean (SEM) values are calculated according to the Equation 3
#SEM=stdev/sqrt(N)   (Equation 3)

Ranked:
True
