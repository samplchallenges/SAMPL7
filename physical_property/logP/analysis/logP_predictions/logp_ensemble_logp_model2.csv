# You may optionally provide predicted logD values; these will be used as a consistency check on our estimated logD values if you submit both logP and pKa values.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#

Method:
The present study attempts to predict the logp for 22 compounds as part of SAMPL7 challenge.
Our workflow consists of four steps as follows: 1)data collection and molecular descriptor calculation, 2)feature extraction, 3)prediction model build, and 4)ensemble prediction. To build prediction models, we applied machine learning approaches such as random forest, XGBoost, and 1D-CNN methods.   We also applied ensembl predictions by combining three prediction models. In order to build prediction models, we calculated various molecular descriptors including physicochemical, topological descriptors, and
molecular fingerprints.
Data collection and molecular descriptor calculation
We collected 2 different datasets which are Martel set (n=707) and PHYSPROP(n=11657) and calculated more than 4000 molecular descriptors may represent logp values.
We applied a meta learning model which utilized already existing logp prediction values, such as Xlogp, Alogp, etc.
Feature selection
Since we calculated more than 4000 molecular descriptors, it is better to select significant descriptors for appropriately representing logp as well as avoiding model overfitting. We recursively eliminate less significant features with the generation of multiple random forest models in each iteration. We obtained 101 features for Martel dataset and 190 features for PHYSPROP dataset to build predictive models.
Model Construction
We applied an ensemble prediction employing three different prediction models, established by random forest, XGBoost, and 1D-CNN respectively. We also applied 5 fold cross validation and each machine learning model predicts the logp values by averaging the five models from each fold.
This model is called, "model2" built by EPI suite's physprop dataset.
Unit conversion
As our model calculates logs we convert it to kcal/mol unit by using the equation: logpow <- ((deltaGw - deltaGo)/(RT))*loge
