Method:
This submission set is designed as a null model which predicts logP of all molecules as the mean clogP of FDA approved oral new chemical entities (NCEs) between the years 1998 and 2017 based on the analysis of Micheal D.Shultz (2019) [1].
Mean clogP of FDA approved oral NCEs approved between 1900-1997, 1998-2007, and 2008-2017 were reported 2.1, 2.4, and 2.9, respectively.
StarDrop clogP calculations [2] were used for this analysis.
We calculated the mean of NCEs approved between 1998 – 2017, which is 2.66, as the early drugs tend to be much smaller and much more hydrophilic than the ones being developed nowadays.

mean clogP = (195 x 2.4 + 214 x 2.9) / (195 + 214) = 2.66
