# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, SM25_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
As a basis we used the logp dataset of the OPERA models (https://github.com/kmansouri/OPERA), accessed September  2020.
This dataset was processed and standardized in Pipeline pilot, we created a test set to test different models, tailored to the challenge (SAMPL_logp_1.xml);
All molecules with an ECFP_6 TC >0.25 compared with the challenge molecules, from the Opera set were flagged as test. (233 molecules) 
The training set was created from the rest of the set,  by subsequently filtering out all molecules with a ECFP_6 TC >0.4 to molecules found in the test set.
Several models were build using D-MPNN (https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop), focusing  on: adding helper tasks (1), changing the parameters of the model(2)

1: adding helper tasks:
We added different datasets that could be complementary in nature, as a separate task in the MT neural network:
LogP data from ChEMBL_26, LogD data from ChEMBL (AZ, doc id: CHEMBL3301361), in-house data.
Based on performance, both the ChEMBL_26, and AZ LogD data from ChEMBL were added. (all public data)
Finally we calculated logp, and LogD for all molecules using Simulations + ADMEpredictor, those predictions were added as additional tasks to the network (so 5 tasks in total)

2: 
Different parameters were explored using the native hyperopt script (250 iterations), and different ensemble sizes.
The final model was trained on all data, using an ensemble size of 10.
Predictions were done on basis of this ensemble,
TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) was estimated from the ensemble predictions. TFE model uncertainty was estimated from the RMSE on the test set (0.388*1.36333619568).
TFE was calculated from logP:   logP *-1.36333619568
#-RT*ln(10)
#-1.36333619568 = -1*(1.985877534*0.001)*298.15 *ln(10)
