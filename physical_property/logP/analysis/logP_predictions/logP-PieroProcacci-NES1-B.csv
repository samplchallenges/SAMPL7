#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, `SM26_micro000 SM26_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty, (optional) logD, (optional) SEM logD
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# You may optionally provide predicted logD values; these will be used as a consistency check on our estimated logD values if you submit both logP and pKa values.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
#
# N.B. the third field is (DG_oct - DG_wat) where DG_oct/wat are the solvation free energies.
# The o/w partition coefficient is defined as LogP = - TFE/(RT log(10))

All NES-1 computations were done on the 24K cores CRESCO6 ENEA cluster
equipped with Intel Skylake 48 cores CPU 2.4 GHz.

For each molecule in water and octanol we launched 480 trajectories (each with 6 NTHREADS) for a total of 2880 cores

Method:

Unidirectional nonequilibrium switching (NES-1) (see
doi:10.1007/s10822-019-00233-9)

HREM stage
In NES-1, for both w and o solvent, only the compound configurations
at full decoupling (lambda=0, gas-phase) are canonically sampled using
Hamiltonian Replica Exchange with Torsional Tempering (HREM-TT) (doi:
10.1002/jcc.21388). Gas-phase HREM-TT (8 ns on the target state and
eight replicas with min. scaling factor of 0.1 [ 3000 K] on a single
molecule in an empty box ) are done by scaling along the replica
progression only the torsional potentials (including the 14 non bonded
interactions).

NS stage
The starting configurations at lambda=0 (no coupling) for the fast
growth (NE) process are prepared by combining 480 gas-phase H-REM
sampled configurations with few snapshots taken from NPT equilibrated
runs of pure solvents. In water and in 1-octanol the nonequilibrium
swicthing (NES) alchemical switch-on (fast growth) time was 300 ps in
both solvents.  LJ interaction were first turned on in the first 240
ps and the molecule was recharged in the following 60 ps. LJ work and
QQ were saved for each trajectory and checked for correlation (see
below).


Post-processing stage

The correlation coefficient and Kendall rank coefficient for the LJ
and Q work are reported below for each system

The solvation free energies are recovered using the Jarzynski estimate
by combining the two independent RV's, LJ work and the electrostatic
work, and by forming the convolution work distribution P(W)=\sum_i P_lj
(W_i)P_{q}(W-W_i) (see doi.org/10.1063/1.5120616 ). The NES
simulations were performed under Periodic Boundary Conditions (mean
box size 40 nm^3 circa in all cases) in the NPT ensemble (standard
conditions, Parrinello Rahman isotropic stress, Nose' thermostats )
using PME-Ewald (alpha=0.37 and 1 Angs grid spacing in the direct
space) and a LJ cut off of 1.3 nm.  Dry ocatonol was used in all
cases.

Force field section.
The force field is GAFF2 (generalized Amber Force Field, version 2,
www.amber.org ).  The FF parameters (bonded, charges and LJ) and
topology of the host and guests molecules were prepared using the
PrimaDORAC interface ( doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00145). The water model
is OPC3 ( doi: 10.1063/1.4960175.). 1-octanol parameterization was
done with PrimaDORAC.
