#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, `SM26_micro000 SM26_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty, (optional) logD, (optional) SEM logD
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# You may optionally provide predicted logD values; these will be used as a consistency check on our estimated logD values if you submit both logP and pKa values.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
#
# N.B. the third field is (DG_oct - DG_wat) where DG_oct/wat are the solvation free energies.
# The o/w partition coefficient is defined as LogP = - TFE/(RT log(10))

Computing and hardware:

The HREM stage (gas-phase) for collecting the initial states with the
ghost solute in the solvent was done on a local Intel i7 quadcore
workstation in about 15 minutes on per molecule

All NES-1 computations were done on the 24K cores CRESCO6 ENEA cluster
equipped with Intel Skylake 48 cores CPU 2.4 GHz.

For each molecule in water and octanol we launched 480 trajectories (each with 6 NTHREADS) for a total of 2880 cores
per solvation/hydration free energy.

The wall clock time was 36 minutes for each solvation/hydration free energy calculations.

Method:

Unidirectional nonequilibrium switching (NES-1) (see
doi:10.1007/s10822-019-00233-9)

HREM stage
In NES-1, for both w and o solvent, only the compound configurations
at full decoupling (lambda=0, gas-phase) are canonically sampled using
Hamiltonian Replica Exchange with Torsional Tempering (HREM-TT) (doi:
10.1002/jcc.21388). Gas-phase HREM-TT (8 ns on the target state and
eight replicas with min. scaling factor of 0.1 [ 3000 K] on a single
molecule in an empty box ) are done by scaling along the replica
progression only the torsional potentials (including the 14 non bonded
interactions).

NS stage
The starting configurations at lambda=0 (no coupling)
for the fast growth (NE) process are prepared by combining 480
gas-phase H-REM sampled configurations with few snapshots taken from
NPT equilibrated runs of pure solvents. In water and in 1-octanol the
nonequilibrium swicthing (NES) alchemical switch-on (fast growth) time
was 300 ps in both solvents.  LJ interaction were first turned on in
the first 240 ps and the molecule was recharged in the following 60
ps.

Post-processing stage

The solvation free energies are recovered using the Jarzynski estimate
evaluated on the 480 work values.  The NES simulations were performed
under Periodic Boundary Conditions (mean box size 40 nm^3 circa in all
cases) in the NPT ensemble (standard conditions, Parrinello Rahman
isotropic stress, Nose' thermostats ) using PME-Ewald (alpha=0.37 and
1 Angs grid spacing in the direct space) and a LJ cut off of 1.3 nm.
Dry ocatonol was used in all cases.

The force field is GAFF2 (generalized Amber Force Field, version 2,
www.amber.org ).  The FF parameters (bonded, charges and LJ) and
topology of the host and guests molecules were prepared using the
PrimaDORAC interface ( doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00145). The water model
is OPC3 ( doi: 10.1063/1.4960175.). 1-octanol parameterization was
done with PrimaDORAC.
