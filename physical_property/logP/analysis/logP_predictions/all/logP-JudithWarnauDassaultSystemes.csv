# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
#
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, `SM26_micro000 SM26_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.,,,

# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.

Computing and hardware:
The average compute time across all molecule was estimated by taking the conformationally most demanding molecule SM36 and conducting a conformer search on standard Think Pad Laptop (Intel Core i7-985H CPU 2.6 GHz, 32GB RAM).
The estimated time on this hardware is 9 CPU-days per molecule including all considered microstates. The average time per microstate is 3 CPU-days. 
In total, we performed more than 8500 BP-TZVP-COSMO geometry optimizations on various standard CPUs.

Workflow
1) We used COSMOquick to generate possible tautomeric states. Irrelevant states where discarded due to an internal energy threshold implemented in COSMOquick.
By a subsequent manual check, we sorted out destroyed molecules and failed calculations. We conducted a conformational search of every microstate with COSMOconf using up to 150 conformers.
2) For each conformer we performed a geometry optimization using the BP86 functional with a TZVP basis set and the COSMO solvation scheme,
followed by a single point energy calculation using the BP86 functional with a def2-TZVPD basis set and the FINE COSMO cavity.
All density functional theory calculations were carried out with the TURBOMOLE 7.5 program package.
We manually checked the outcome for destroyed molecules and failed calculations.
3) A conformer selection was done by applying COSMOconf (using internally COSMOtherm) to reduce the number of conformers and tautomers for the neutral molecule sets.
The final set of the neutral state contains only those conformers and states that are relevant in liquid solutions.
This set may contain various microstates, if they have not been identified as irrelevant in one of the steps before.
4) The COSMOtherm software, version 2020, was used to calculate the free energy difference for each molecule set from step 2 and to calculate the relative weight of the microstates in water.
All free energy calculations were carried out using the BP-TZVPD-FINE 20 level of COSMO-RS in COSMOtherm.
Within the used COSMO-RS an ensemble of conformers and microstates is automatically used and weighted according to the total free energy in the respective liquid phase, i.e. different weights are used in water and octanol.

The applied COSMO-RS version BP-TZVPD-FINE 20 shows a general root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.6 kcal/mol with regard to experimental octanol/water partitioning data.
COSMO-RS algorithm by itself has no statistical error. The overall workflow including the conformational search (or molecule or state) has a statistical noise smaller than 0.1 kcal/mol.
