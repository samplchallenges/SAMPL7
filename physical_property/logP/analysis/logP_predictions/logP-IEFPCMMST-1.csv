# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_micro000`, `SM26_micro000 SM26_extra001`)
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty, (optional) logD, (optional) SEM logD
#
# Your transfer free energy prediction for the neutral form does NOT have to be `SMXX_micro000` (which is the challenge provided neutral microstate).

# You may optionally provide predicted logD values; these will be used as a consistency check on our estimated logD values if you submit both logP and pKa values.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary).

Method:
The IEFPCM/MST method is a quantum mechanical (QM) self-consistent continuum solvation method that have proved to be a cost-effective approach for the calculation of solvation free energies in differents solvents. From the computation of the solvation free energies in water and n-octanol the partition coefficient is determined. In the Miertus−Scrocco−Tomasi model, the solvation free energy is calculated by adding nonelectrostatic and electrostatic contributions, which are calculated using a double molecule-shaped cavity for the solute embedded in the polarizable continuum medium.The IEFPCM/MST method used to estimate log P, can be subdivided into two parts. In the first step, we use the Frog 2.14 software, that helped us to know the conformational preferences of the set of 22 molecules. In this case, due to their structure and complexity, we limited the number of generated conformations to 15. Once reviewed and inspected the correct study of the conformational space as well as eliminating the redundant conformations, the second part of the method is based on QM calculations, using the Gaussian 16 package. Then, the conformations obtained with Frog 2.14 were optimized using MST method, both in water and in octanol, at B3LYP / 6-31G (d) theory level, checking the frequencies of all of them. After this step, those conformations with negative frequencies were ignored for the subsequent steps. Then, single point calculations were performed in gas, water and octanol, all of them at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. All single point calculations were used to estimate the Solvation Free Energy for each of the conformations. Moreover, Thermal Correction to Gibbs Free Energy was also added to all of them. The total energy of each conformer was weighted using the Boltzmann approximation. Finally, an average energy for the octanol and water structure was obtained that permit us obtaining the difference dG Octanol-dG Water and consequently its log P.
