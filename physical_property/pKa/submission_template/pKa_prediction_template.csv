# RELATIVE FREE ENERGY PREDICTIONS (for pKa prediction)
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit relative free energy (RFE) predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report RFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and RFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, include the following:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty, SMILES string of the predicted microstate
#
# The molecule ID of the other microstate needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary)
# Also email us the `.mol2` file of your microstate with explicit hydrogens and correct bond orders,
# Please send the `.mol2` file to the email listed on the instructions page.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

#
#
# Please list your name, using only UTF-8 characters as described above. The "Participant name:" entry is required.

#
#
# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used.
# The name of the method should not exceed 40 characters.
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here.
Name:

#
#
# COMPUTE TIME SECTION
#
# Please provide the average compute time across all of the molecules.
# For physical methods, report the GPU and/or CPU compute time in hours.
# For empirical methods, report the query time in hours.
# Create a new line for each processor type.
# The 'Compute time:' keyword is required as shown here.
Compute time:

#
# COMPUTING AND HARDWARE SECTION
#
# Please provide details of the computing resources that were used to train models and make predictions.
# Please specify compute time for training models and querying separately for empirical prediction methods.
# Provide a detailed description of the hardware used.
# The 'Computing and hardware:' keyword is required as shown here.
Computing and hardware:

# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# List all major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The 'Software:' keyword is required.
Software:

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State if your prediction method is better classified as an
# experimental database lookup (DL), linear free energy relationship (LFER),
# quantitative structure-property relationship or machine learning (QSPR/ML),
# quantum mechanics without empirical correction (QM) model, quantum mechanics with
# linear empirical correction (QM+LEC), and combined quantum mechanics and molecular
# mechanics (QM+MM), or Other, using the following category labels:
# `DL`, `LFER`, `QSPR/ML`, `QM`, `QM+LEC`, `QM+MM` or `Other`.
#
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters with units.
# Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
#
# We strongly encourage you to submit your predicted macro pKa values in this section in consecutive lines following this format:
# compound name, macro pKa, initial formal charge, formal charge after transition, e.g.:
# SM25, 3.5, 0, +1
# This will allow us to check that our analysis of your free energies leads to the same endpoint as your analysis.
#
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
Method:


#
#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
Ranked:
True
