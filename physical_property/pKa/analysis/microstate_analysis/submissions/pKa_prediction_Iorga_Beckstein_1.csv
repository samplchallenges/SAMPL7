# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty,
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, include the following:,
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty, SMILES string of the predicted microstate
#
# The molecule ID of the other microstate needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary)

Method:
For the pKa prediction we followed the method that we used in the SAMPL6 pKa prediction challenge (Selwa, E., Kenney, I. M., Beckstein, O., and Iorga,B. I. SAMPL6: calculation of macroscopic pKa values from ab initio quantum mechanical free energies,J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2018,32,1203-1216 DOI: 10.1007/s10822-018-0138-6.), which is based on the method described in Muckerman JT, Skone JH, Ning M,Wasada-Tsutsui Y. Toward the accurate calculation of pKa values in water and acetonitrile. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013,1827,882-891.
With this method we calculated the relative energies for the microstates provided by the organizers,as well as for 4 reference compounds with structures similar compared with the compounds from the SAMPL7-pKa dataset and for which experimental pKa values are available. These reference compounds are compound 26 from Borhade SR, Svensson R, Brandt P, Artursson P, Arvidsson PI,Sandstrom A. Preclinical characterization of acyl sulfonimidamides: potential carboxylic acid bioisosteres with tunable properties. ChemMedChem. 2015 Mar;10(3):455-60. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201402497. and compounds 12,13 and 14 from Lassalas P, Gay B, Lasfargeas C, James MJ, Tran V, Vijayendran KG, Brunden KR, Kozlowski MC, Thomas CJ,Smith AB 3rd, Huryn DM,Ballatore C. Structure Property Relationships of Carboxylic Acid Isosteres. J Med Chem. 2016 Apr 14;59(7):3183-203. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01963.
The experimental values compared with the energy corresponding to the difference between the experimental and computed pKa values were plotted,and the linear fitting of these values (R2=0.867) using Microsoft Excel provided the correction to be applied to the SAMPL7 pKa calculations.,
Therefore, the microscopic relative free energies and the macroscopic pKa values reported here were corrected using this procedure to remove the systematic error related to the QM calculations.,
