# COMPUTING AND HARDWARE SECTION
#
Computing and hardware:
All simulations were performed on the Pitzer Cluster at the Ohio Supercomputer Center
(https://www.osc.edu/resources/technical_support/supercomputers/pitzer).
The reported compute time is taken as the walltime times the number of processors (core hours).
Pitzer has a mix of processors. We did not specify the processor type upon submission, so a mix was used.,
The original Pitzer cluster was installed in late 2018 and
is a Dell-built,Intel Xeon Skylake processor-based supercomputer with 260 nodes.,
In September 2020,OSC installed an additional 398 Intel Xeon Cascade Lake processor-based,
nodes as part of a Pitzer Expansion cluster.

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
Method:
Calculations were performed by the Gaussian 16 revision E01 series of programs using one hybrid density functional M06-2X,6-31+G(d,p) as basis set,
and the SMD implicit solvation model. Geometries were fully optimized in aqueous solution. Harmonic frequencies were calculated to confirm that the
structures were minima on the potential energy surface and to obtain the thermal and entropic contributions to the free energies.
The calculation of pKa was based on the use of the direct approach, given by the proton dissociation reaction. The pKa value of the ,
molecule HA was calculated according to the following equation
pKa= G*aq/2.303RT; G*aq= G*aq,A- + G*aq,H+ - G*aq,HA
where G*aq,A- and G*aq,HA are the standard free energies of the deprotonated and protonated species, respectively,calculated directly in aqueous solution at 298.15 K.,
To improve the calculation of the solvation effects that are important for pKa calculations, mainly in charged structures, we included one explicit water molecules
directly hydrogen-bonded to the site being protonated/deprotonated. For each hydrogen bonding site, several orientations of the added water were considered and only ,
the lowest-energy structure was used.
