Method:
This submission is the first step in attempts to improve a Gaussian process pKa predictor previously submitted in the SAMPL6 challenge \cite{bannan2018sampl6}. For the features and model parameters, please refer to the work by Bannan et al. The ten features used in the previous model were closely followed here. Six features are the AM1BCC partial charges described by Bannan et al. Partial charges were computed using Openforcefield and RDKit. Two other features are the free energy of solvation and the change in enthalpy. These were both computed using OpenEye-toolkits. The remaining two features are solvent accessible surface area of the deprotonated atom via the Shrake algorithm and the partial bond order via the extended Hückel molecular orbital method to obtain the overlap populations, both calculated using RDKit.
The primary difference between these two models is the training set. Our hand curated training set consists of approximately 3500 small molecules entirely from open-source databases. Approximately 40 small molecules with sulfonamide groups were added in attempt to assist predictions and increase chemical diversity. Model validation suggests a subset (1122 monoprotic) of the dataset gives the best training set for optimal kernel parameters. The optimized kernel parameters used for making predictions were obtained by executing a 4-fold model validation procedure. As suggested by Bannan et al., we added a small subset of diprotic acids and all monoprotics that had experimental pKas between 0 and 12 back into the training set (2752 total) to increase the chemical space when making predictions.
Statistical uncertainty in micro-pKa was computed during model validation. The standard Gaussian process model automatically provides uncertainties that correspond to how closely the molecule of interest overlaps with the molecules in the training set. Note that the predictions reported have have high uncertainty due to the lack of chemical space in the training set as well as the lack of similarity of the molecules of interest to that of the molecules found in the training set.  Microscopic pKa values are directly related to relative free energies and were computed following the work by Gunner et al.\cite{gunner2020standard} in units of kcal/mol.
