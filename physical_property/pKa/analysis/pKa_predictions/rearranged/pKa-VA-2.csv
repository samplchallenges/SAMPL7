Computing and hardware:
All the simulations were performed with GPU01 and CURIE clusters
GPU01,Intel Xeon E5-2697A /32 Core-NVIDIA GK210GL [Tesla K80] x 4 G4GB RAM,
CURIE,Intel Xeon E7-4870 v2s/120 core-512GB RAM,

Software:

Category:
Physical (QM)

Method:
All possible conformations of the ligands are located with the semi-empirical PM3 method by using the SPARTAN software. Free rotations around single bonds are taken into account and all the geometries corresponding to stationary points are re-optimised with the Gaussian software package by density functional theory (DFT) using the M052X functional and the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. Solvation Model based on Density (SMD) method at 298.15K is used for the optimizations of the conformations in water.,
Thermodynamic Cycle 3 was used to calculate the pKa values of the molecules for the global minima (Equation 1)
pKa(AH)=(DG_soln/2.303RT)+pKa(BH) (Equation 1)
where BH represents a reference molecule which is similar in structure to the molecules questioned
For the calculation of standard error of mean (SEM),standard deviations (stdev) are calculated according to the Equation 2 where value is the RFE of each molecule, mean is the mean of RFEs of the molecules of interest and N is the size of the population
stdev = sqrt((1/(N-1))*(sum of (value-mean)^2))  (Equation 2)
After calculation of standard deviations,standard error of mean (SEM) values are calculated according to the Equation 3,
SEM=stdev/sqrt(N)   (Equation 3)
