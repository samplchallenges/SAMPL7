Computing and hardware: 
All simulations were performed on the Pitzer Cluster at the Ohio Supercomputer Center
(https://www.osc.edu/resources/technical_support/supercomputers/pitzer).
The reported compute time is taken as the walltime times the number of processors (core hours).
Pitzer has a mix of processors. We did not specify the processor type upon submission, so a mix was used.
The original Pitzer cluster was installed in late 2018 and
is a Dell-built, Intel Xeon Skylake processor-based supercomputer with 260 nodes.
In September 2020, OSC installed an additional 398 Intel Xeon Cascade Lake processor-based
nodes as part of a Pitzer Expansion cluster.

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
Method:
Calculations were performed by the Gaussian 16 revision E01 series of programs using one hybrid density functional M06-2X, 6-31+G(d,p) as basis set, 
and the SMD implicit solvation model. Geometries were fully optimized in aqueous solution. Harmonic frequencies were calculated to confirm that the 
structures were minima on the potential energy surface and to obtain the thermal and entropic contributions to the free energies. 
In the geometry optimizations, the surface type and the scaling factor options in the SCRF section were tuned. By choosing SAS as the 
solute-solvent boundary, the solvent radius (1.385 A for water) is added to the intrinsic Coulomb radii to construct the cavity. 
It is necessary to add the scale factor a = 0.485 and the surface of SAS.
The calculation of pKa was based on the use of the direct approach, given by the proton dissociation reaction. The pKa value of the 
molecule HA was calculated according to the following equation
     pKa= G*aq/2.303RT; G*aq= G*aq,A- + G*aq,H+ - G*aq,HA 
where G*aq,A- and G*aq,HA are the standard free energies of the deprotonated and protonated species, respectively, calculated directly in aqueous solution at 298.15 K.
