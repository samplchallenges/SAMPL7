# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit relative free energy (RFE) predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report RFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and RFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, include the following:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty, SMILES string of the predicted microstate
#
# The molecule ID of the other microstate needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary)
# Also email us the `.mol2` file of your microstate with explicit hydrogens and correct bond orders,
# Please send the `.mol2` file to the email listed on the instructions page.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
Method:
Def2-TZVP basis sets were used for all calculations.
All calculations were performed in either Gaussian 09 or Gaussian 16.
All challenge molecules were converted to 3d coordinates using OpenBabel
from the SMILES string. Structures were then optimized with the B3LYP density
 functional and were verified to be local minima via frequency calculations
 on an ‘ultrafine’ integration grid with harmonic frequencies. Relative Free
 Energies (RFE) were determined by using the thermodynamic cycle to calculate
 the "reaction free energies" (i.e., HA-> A- + H+, including the proton
 free energy of solvation) in both the gas and aqueous phases. Following,
 the RFE was determined by determining the difference between the enumerated
 microstate's reaction and the reference microstate (i.e., ∆Gsolv(SMXX_micro001)-∆Gsolv(SMXX_micro000)).
 All RFE's are reported in kcal/more.
