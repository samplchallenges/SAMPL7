# SAMPL7 pK<sub>a</sub> Prediction Challenge

The SAMPL7 pK<sub>a</sub> Challenge consists of predicting relative free energies between microstates to determine the pK<sub>a</sub> of 22 molecules. Free energies were chosen rather than pK<sub>a</sub> values given the recent work of [Gunner et al.](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10822-020-00280-7.pdf). All possible tautomers of each ionization (charge) state are defined as distinct protonation microstates. Our aim is to evaluate how well current pK<sub>a</sub> prediction methods perform with these 22 molecules through blind predictions. Challenge participants are asked to predict free energy differences between microstates. Challenge organizers have a reference microstate for each compound, and all free energies must be predicted relative to this reference state, as detailed in the challenge instructions linked below. This challenge is *optional* and will be run at the same time as the log *P* and permeability challenge (both of which are also optional).  

Instructions for the pK<sub>a</sub> challenge: [`pKa_challenge_instructions.md`](pKa_challenge_instructions.md)

Submission template for the pK<sub>a</sub> challenge: [`submission_template/pKa_prediction_template.csv`](submission_template/pKa_prediction_template.csv)

We would like to note that compounds `SM35`, `SM36` and `SM37` are enantiopure and have a chiral center. All other compounds are not chiral. The version of these compounds with specified chirality should be used; refer to challenge instructions for more details.

Experimental pK<sub>a</sub> measurements will made available after the challenge deadline.
